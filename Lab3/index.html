1. google.com

3. spotify.com
</h1>
<p>This is my favorite website because it is extremely useful
with just about every aspect of my life. Grammarly is really 
helpful in learning how to edit and proofread essays efficiently.
Spotify is the best for streaming music when study or even
just to learn about new, fun music.</p>

My Favorite 6 Things:
1. Basketball
2. Baking and Cooking
3. Computers and Cybersecurity
4. Sports
5. Pop & Hip Hop music
6. Outside activities
</h1>
<p>
I like all of these things because they are important parts in my life.
Whenever I get stressed out or frustrated, basketball helps me calm down.
Baking and cooking are two things I do over the holidays with family.
Computers are how I have and will continue to make a living, and
sports and music are two hobbies of mine in any freetime. Outside
activities are my favorite way to make new friends and have a good time.

Typestyle Examples:
</h1>

<p style=font-family:verdana>
<b>
This is an example paragraph with a different typestyle than
the standard for html pages. The font should be in the style of
verdana, but the color should remain the same. In my next paragraph,
I will change the color of the text to make it look different.
This text has also been boldened.

<p style=color:red>
<i>
This is an example paragraph with a different typestyle
than the standrd for html pages. In this case, the font should be
the same, but the color of the text should be red. This text has also
been italicized to show the significance of different HTML typestyles.
